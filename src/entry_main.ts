 *  - loaded: The number of elements that have been loaded so far during the initial loading phase. Once the initial
 *    loading phase finishes, it should hold that loaded == people.length.
 *  - refresh: A method that triggers a refresh for one position in the list. This refresh occurs asynchronously,
 *    and the context object will update the item in the people list directly.
 * 
 * Note that this is only the interface. Implementation of this interface is below. Also note that

/**
 * This class is a custom HTML element that is responsible for displaying one
 * `PersonListItem`. As such, most of its "logic" will be included in its
 * HTML template.
 *
 * In reality (and especially for even more complex list items), we might want
 * to further split this up into smaller subcomponents. For example, we might
 * have one custom HTML element for showing the loading state, another HTML
 * element for showing the error state, and a collection of reusable HTML
 * components for showing the details of for one person. Of course, the
 * decision of when to split up a component into smaller subcomponents is
 * somewhat subjective, and here, we will be fine with just having one "fat"
 * component that is responsible for all the possible states of one list item.
 *
 * There are generally two ways in which this element can "get" the data
 * that it should be displaying (a simple example of this is provided in
 * the `list_examples.ts` file):
 *
 * First, the data can be provided through attributes. For example, the
 * element could have an `error` attribute as well as attributes `person-name`,
 * `person-year`, `person-country`, etc. (alternatively, we could have
 * a `person-json` attribute that contains all data as a JSON string, and we
 * simply parse this JSON). In this scenario, it is the responsibility
 * of the parent element to populate these attributes correctly once
 * they are loaded/changed.
 *
 * Second option is to have some kind of identifier attribute (in this case
 * `position`), and this attribute is used to directly retrieve the data
 * from an instance of `PeopleListContext`. This identifier still needs to be
 * provided by some parent element, but it is expected that it will not change
 * often. As such the parent element does not have to interact with the
 * list item when the item changes state, only when the items are re-arranged.
 *
 * Here, we are aiming for the second approach, but feel free to try the first
 * one as well (again, `list_examples.ts` should be an inspiration, but there
 * isn't one "best" solution).
